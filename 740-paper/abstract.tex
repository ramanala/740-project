\section{Abstract}
\label{sec-abstract}
We study the protocols and architecture of a popular cloud communication service \textit{Twilio} through gray box methods. We develop a simple VoIP service atop \textit{Twilio} for our study. We provide insights into how different components in a cloud communication service interact with each other in various scenarios. We also measure some guarantees with respect to call and message dequeuing provided by Twilio. Our analysis reveals a number of interesting aspects about the Twilio ecosystem and have strong implications for developers who build applications on top of \textit{Twilio} APIs.
