\label{sec-abstract}
Cloud communication service (CCS) with its simplicity and lower investment cost is becoming increasingly popular. In contrast to its growing popularity, very little is known about the internals of CCS with respect to its architecture and protocols. To gain insights into CCS, we study 
%the protocols and architecture of 
a popular cloud communication service "\textit{Twilio}" using gray box techniques. 
 %For our study, we develop a simple VoIP service atop \textit{Twilio}. Using our service and logs collected at several places, 
In our study, we  provide insights into the Twilio ecosystem, its components, the interaction among components and the protocols.
%how different components in Twilio interact with each other in various scenarios. 
We also measure some guarantees 
%with respect to call and message dequeuing 
provided by Twilio and show how the measurements fair against what is promised. Our analysis un-veils a number of interesting aspects about the Twilio ecosystem and has strong implications for developers who want to build applications on top of \textit{Twilio} APIs.
