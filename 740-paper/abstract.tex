\section{Abstract}
\label{sec-abstract}
Cloud communication service with its simplicity and lower investment cost is being increasingly popular.
We study the protocols and architecture of a popular cloud communication service \textit{Twilio} using gray box techniques. For our study, we develop a simple VoIP service atop \textit{Twilio}. Using our service and logs collected at several places, we provide insights into how different components in a cloud communication service interact with each other in various scenarios. We also measure some guarantees with respect to call and message dequeuing provided by Twilio. Our analysis reveals a number of interesting aspects about the Twilio ecosystem and have strong implications for developers who build applications on top of \textit{Twilio} APIs.
