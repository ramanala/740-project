\section{Discussion}
\label{sec-discussion}
We now discuss some possible enhancements to the entire \textit{Twilio} ecosystem. 

\subsection{Client Library Improvements}
We showed that the client library can be optimized to save few RTTs in the previous section. It is important to notice that we identified this just by manually studying the behavior of the client library. We believe that there should be more robust and extensive ways to study the client's iteraction with the server. We also showed in the previos section that fault handling mechanisms are not uniform across the system spanning the service and the client library.
