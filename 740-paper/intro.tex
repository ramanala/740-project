\section{Introduction}
\label{sec-intro}

Cloud communication services are Internet-based voice and data communication service providers where telecommunications applications, switching and storage are hosted by a third-party outside of the organization using them, and they are accessed over the public Internet~\cite{wikicc}. 
Cloud communications providers deliver voice & data communications applications and services, hosting them on servers that the providers own and maintain, giving their customers access to the cloud. Because they only pay for services or applications they use, customers have a more cost-effective, reliable and secure communications environment, without the headaches associated with more conventional PBX system deployment.
