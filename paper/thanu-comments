Thanu's comments
================
1. Mention that protocols are complex because fsync is slow - DONE
2. Remove the bit about protocol complexity from there. Move it earlier? - DONE
3. Bring in the bit about analogy: concurrent program, use locks -> correct. - HARD, NOT SURE
storage program, use fsyncs -> correct. Performance down as you use more locks
or fsyncs.
concurrency bugs happen only in certain interleavings -> same here. only in
certain crash states. Both high in numbers and hard to find.
4. Be careful about saying things we know etc
5. Remove the definition of crash vulnerability from 2.4 - DONE
6. Rewrite the part abotu scoping persistence properties. - REMOVED
7. Estimating part - part about static analysis could be wrong. - REMOVED
8. When talking about persistence properties, "file" and "data" are vague
terms. - DONE
9. Rewrite the part about special cases in btrfs carefully again. - DONE
10. 4.1 -> superset : modern file systems
11. Explain atomicity better - not very intuitive currently.
12. Address Andrea's comments about it also.
