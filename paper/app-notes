Notes from appdoctor:
- app intro
- well-tested
- popular
- widely used
- thus form a good benchmark
- summary of how long it took to check each application
    - num of system calls in update protocol?
    - num of micro-code operations?

One section should be about evaluating the tool itself:
======================================================
- does Detector find bugs?
- what are the applications in which it found bugs?
    - users? impact?
- what are the numbers we report?
    - static numbers, to avoid inflating the bug count
    - Only non-trivial ones that cannot be easily fixed.
- how fast does it find bugs?
- does it find already known bugs?
- Is there a limit on the size of the trace it can handle?
- reported bugs
    - how many confirmed?
    - how many already known?

Another section would be about the vulnerability study:
======================================================
- this section is going to be inherently weak because we have only a dozen
  applications
- inform the design of future applications, update protocols, and file systems  
- section, teach readers about the protocols
    - visually represent git
- What are the common trends in update protocols?
    - System calls used
    - Guarantees given?

- What vulnerabilities did we find?
- What consequences did those vuls have?
- Which file systems would these vulnerabilities be exposed on?
- Experience
    - Random interesting things we found during our study
    - Need complicated workloads
    - Need good checkers 
    - Sometimes recovery breaks things [LevelDB]
    - LMDB can lose really old data
    - Recovery possible, but not done [HSQLDB, BDB]

What-If Questions
=================
Questions about how modifying the file system would affect application
correctness. 
- we can answer based on the traces that we have. 


Wrap these into ALC
===================
fsync() vs write with O_SYNC -> VMWare, LevelDB

locks are used for isoltation - git, sqlite
