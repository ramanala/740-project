Timeline
=======
First file system - atomic, synchronous, ordered
Too slow.
First optimization, buffering.
    - ext2 (1992)
Caused inconsistency.
Solution 1: synchronous metadata updates
    - FFS (84), DOS(88), VMS (90), 
Curious that ext2 came after this, did not use synchronous metadata updates.
    - because it was too slow!
    - ext2 (1992)
Solution 2: techniques like shadow paging or WAL
    - techniques: Cedar (87), Episode (92), Mime (92), LFS(92), WAFL (94)
    - journaling - ext3 (98)
Performance is a relentless driver. More optimizations.   
XFS (jan 2001)
- delayed allocation (mar 2004)    
- rename, trunc fixes (june 2006)
ext4 (2008)
- delayed allocation (Oct 2008)
- rename, trunc fixes (June 2009) 
Btrfs (2009)    
- Has delayed allocation, rename handling etc from the start
