\mycaption{fig-dependencies}{Application Vulnerabilities}{\footnotesize The
figure shows how an application interacts with different file systems. The
application uses the POSIX standard to interface with file systems. However,
the application also depends on the persistence properties (PP) of ext4. The
grey dotted lines each signify a crash vulnerability in the application. When
the application is run on top of other file systems, the vulnerabilities may
cause application inconsistency in the event of a crash.}
