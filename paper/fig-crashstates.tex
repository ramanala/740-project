The figure shows the initial, final, and some of the intermediate crash states
possible for the workload described in Section~\ref{sec-ppexample} . X
represents garbage data in the files. Intermediate states \#A and \#B represent
different kinds of atomicity violations, while intermediate state \#C
represents an ordering violation.
