\section{Evaluating New File-System Designs}
\label{sec-fs-what-if}

Our framework allows us to consider any new file-system design that affects
atomicity and ordering and updates, and evaluate how the new design affects
application correctness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework by
evaluating some design ideas that have not been implemented in file systems
yet. 

\subsection{Atomic Appends}
What if file systems provided atomic append operations? This would be
relatively easy to provide in a journaling file system. We find it resolves
vulnerabilities in a number of applications.

\subsection{Dual-Ordering File Systems}
We consider a file-system design where there are two global orderings: all the
updates that are forced to disk are totally ordered, and all other updates have
another total ordering among themselves.

We find that this approach solves a number of application vulnerabilities.
