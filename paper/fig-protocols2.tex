\mycaption{fig-protocols}{Update Protocols}{\footnotesize 
The figure shows pseudo-code for the simplified update protocols for three
different configurations of SQLite. The size of each write is indicated. The
first protocol is vulnerable to either a process or system crash. The second
protocol is correct in the face of a process crash, but vulnerable to a system
crash. The last protocol is correct in the face of both process and system
crashes.
