% Motivate the problem
%Applications such as embedded databases and key-value stores must remain
%consistent after a crash. To maintain crash consistency without losing
%performance, applications use complex update protocols to persist their state. 

We study the protocols and architecture of a popular cloud communication service \textit{Twilio} through gray box methods. We develop a simple VoIP service atop \textit{Twilio} for our study. We provide insights into how different components in a cloud communication service interact with each other in various scenarios. We also measure some guarantees with respect to call and message dequeuing provided by Twilio. Our analysis reveals a number of interesting aspects about the Twilio ecosystem and have strong implications for developers who build applications on top of Twilio APIs.
