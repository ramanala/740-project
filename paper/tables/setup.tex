 & Guarantees  & Assumed persistence properties & Tested Parameters and Configurations & Workload &  Checker & Protocol (short description) \\ \hline
Git & Fuzzy. Expected to work correctly on top of ordered file system, and with fsyncobjectfiles configuration. Manual recovery might be needed. & Fully Ordered. fsyncobjectfiles offers some protection against unordered (66\% performance loss). & - & & Remove lock files. status, show-ref, log, fsck, add, rm, commit, checkout. & (Explained in detail later) \\ \cline{1-4}\cline{6-8}
Mercurial & No promises on system crash. Manual recovery procedures listed in documentation. Two types of corruption: dirstate and repository. & N\slash{}A & - & add two files; commit; & Remove lock files. Perform all documented manual recovery procedures, (short of restoring repository from backup, or cloning). Two checkers Â– dirstate corruption: status. repository corruption: show-ref, log, fsck, add, rm, commit, checkout. & Dirstate information: update-via-rename. Repository information: Journal information to multiple log files before updating data files. Journal files later renamed to `undo journals' to rewind a commit. \\ \hline
BerkeleyDB & Durability and consistency depending on workload parameters. & Atomic writes within page boundaries. Checksum option relieves assumption (X\% performance loss). & SYNC, NO\_SYNC, WRITE\_NO\_SYNC; BTree, Hash; mmap() and no mmap() & Insert(enough key-value pairs to trigger multiple log file switches). Triggers level-zero compaction for LevelDB. & Switch on checksums, open with log recovery enabled, and retrieve all key-value pairs; check for sanity. Insert (two pairs) & Write-ahead logging \\  \cline{1-4}\cline{6-8}
LevelDB & Durability depending on workload parameters. Consistent and ordered always. & None. & Sync = on\slash{}off &  & Do RecoverDB with checksum verification, retrieve all key-value pairs with checksum verification; check for sanity. Insert (two pairs) & Write-ahead-logging with multi-level background (parallel) compaction \\ \hline
LMDB & Durability and consistency depending on configuration. & None. & Sync = on\slash{}off; metasync=on\slash{}off & Insert(three key-value pairs). Vacuum database. For GDBM. & Retrieve all key-value pairs; check for sanity. Insert (two pairs). Call environment.stat(). & Shadow paging multi-version concurrency control (two versions) \\  \cline{1-4}\cline{6-8}
GDBM & Unclear consistency. Durability after completing insert, depending on workload parameters. & N\slash{}A & Sync = on\slash{}off &  & Retrieve all key-value pairs; check for sanity. Insert (two pairs). & Inserts: Append new data, update metadata in-place. Vacuum: Update-via-rename. \\ \hline
HSqlDB & Durability depending on workload parameters. Consistent and ordered always. & None. & Write delay = 0\slash{}500ms & Insert multiple, big transactions &  & Write-ahead logging, with multiple update-via-renames during checkpointing. \\ \cline{1-5}\cline{7-8}
SQLite & Durability and consistency configurable. & None by default. Configurable, upto 250\% performance improvement. & WAL\slash{}Rollback; Synchronous=Full, Normal & Insert transactions. Trigger checkpoint in WAL mode. & Retrieve transactions, insert two additional transactions. & Rollback\slash{}WAL depending on configuration.  \\  \cline{1-5}\cline{7-8}
Postgres & Durability configurable. Consistent always. & None. & Sync = on\slash{}off & Insert multiple, big transactions &  & Write-ahead logging \\ \hline
VMWare & Host-caching configurable. FLUSH commands consistent and durable without host-caching. & None. & Static\slash{}dynamic vmdk file. Single\slash{}multiple vmdk files. & Write to two blocks from within guest. Fsync() special file after each block-write. & Use VMWare mount. Written data should be present after fsync() returns within guest. & Write block data in-place; fsync(); update vmdk header synchronously in-place. \\ \hline
HDFS & FS operations are consistent and durable. & None. & None. & Create hierarchical directories and files within directories. & Created directories and files should be retrievable after the creating operations return. & Save metadata of exposed file system within a single file using WAL. \\ \hline
